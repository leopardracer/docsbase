title: "Contribute to the Smart Wallet Docs"
---

This guide is intended for all contributors who are adding new features, content, or making updates to the Smart Wallet documentation.
Following these guidelines ensures consistency and maintains
the documentation structure, making it easier for developers to find information.

**Why Documentation is Important**

Good documentation significantly accelerates developer adoption. Focus on creating content that helps developers understand and implement Smart Wallet features efficiently, while maintaining the documentation's structural integrity.

## Documentation Structure Guidelines

### Core Principle: Maintain Existing Structure

The Smart Wallet documentation is organized into the following main sections:

1. **Quickstart**
2. **Concepts**
3. **Guides**
4. **Examples**
5. **Technical Reference**
6. **Contribute**

<Warning>
  **Do not create new top-level sections**
  
  All new content must fit within these existing sections.

</Warning>

### Section Purpose and Content Placement

When adding new content, determine the appropriate section based on the following criteria:

#### Quickstart

- End-to-end guides for getting developers up and running quickly
- Should remain focused and concise
- Update only when there are fundamental changes to the initial setup process

#### Concepts

- Explanatory content about Smart Wallet components, architecture, and design philosophy
- Add new concept documentation when introducing fundamentally new capabilities or paradigms
- Subsections include:
  - Intro
  - Built-in Features
  - Optional Features
  - Additional conceptual topics as needed

#### Guides

- Step-by-step tutorials for specific tasks and implementation scenarios
- **All guides should live under the main "Guides" section**
- Avoid creating deep hierarchical subsections unless absolutely necessary
- Try to keep the number of subsections to a minimum, preferably only one page per guide
- Although not required, guides should preferably have an accompanying GitHub repository
- Name guides clearly with action-oriented titles (e.g., "Implementing Multi-Signature Verification" rather than "Multi-Sig Guide")

#### Examples

- Complete, working code examples demonstrating real-world use cases
- Each example should be self-contained and fully functional
- Each example should have an accompanying GitHub repository
- Include comments explaining key implementation details
- Examples should cover all of the built-in and optional features of the Smart Wallet

#### Technical Reference

- Comprehensive technical documentation of APIs, methods, components, and configurations
- Structured reference material rather than tutorial content
- Include parameter descriptions, return values, and usage examples
- All technical specifications for new features go here, not in separate sections

#### Contribute

- Information for contributors to the Smart Wallet project
- Update when contribution processes change

<Warning>
**Avoiding Subsection Proliferation**
- **For Guides**: Keep all guides at the same level under the Guides section
- **For Technical Reference**: Organize by component or feature, not by use case
- When tempted to add a new subsection, consider if the content could be reorganized to fit existing sections
- Use cross-referencing between related content rather than creating new organizational structures

</Warning>

## Documentation Style Guidelines

### Writing Style

1. **Be concise**: Use simple, direct language. Avoid unnecessary words.
2. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology throughout documentation.
3. **Persona-focused**: Think about the persona of the reader and write accordingly.
4. **Happy Path**: Focus on the happy path, but don't forget to mention the alternative paths.
5. [**AI-friendly**](#ai-friendly-writing-tips): Write in a way that is easy for AI to understand and follow.

<Warning>
**Make sure to review any AI generated content**

If you use AI to generate content:

- Make sure to review it carefully before submission.
- Make sure that the content follows the guidelines in this document.
- Make sure that the content is easy for AI to understand and follow.

</Warning>

### AI-friendly Writing Tips

- Make sure you use explicit language in your file names, headings, and content.
- Make active linking references to the relevant guides and examples.
- Use bulleted lists for steps or options.
- Explicitly name and reference the libraries you are using.
- Use code blocks to highlight code.
- Use semantic urls that make sense even without context. Avoid abbreviations.

<Check>
  **Think like a Large Language Model**

When writing documentation, think about how a Large Language Model would understand the content.

You should continuously ask yourself:

- "Would a Large Language Model be able to understand this content?"
- "Would a Large Language Model be able to follow this content?"
- "Would a Large Language Model be able to use this content?"

If you can't answer yes to all of these questions, you need to rewrite the content.

</Check>

### Formatting

1. **Markdown usage**:

   - Use proper heading hierarchy (# for main titles, ## for section headings, etc.)
   - Use code blocks with language specification (```javascript)
   - Use tables for parameter references
   - Use bulleted lists for steps or options

2. **Code examples**:
   - Include complete, working code examples
   - Comment code thoroughly
   - Follow the project's coding style guide

### Abbreviations and Terminology

1. **First reference**: The first time you use an abbreviation or technical term, spell it out followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. Example: "Account Abstraction (AA)"
2. **Consistency**: Use the same term for the same concept throughout the documentation
3. **Technical Reference**: Keep the guides and examples to a minimal size. Put the comprehensive technical details in the Technical Reference section.
